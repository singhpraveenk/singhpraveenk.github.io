I hold a Ph.D. from the Centre of Excellence in Disaster Mitigation & Management at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India, focused on "Black carbon aerosols, Himalayan glaciers, and future climate variability." My research centers on questions about the <b>Himalayan Cryosphere, Carbonous Aerosols, and Climate Change</b>. I often use radiative transfer, radiation balance, and hydrological models in my research.


I work at <a href="https://wri-india.org/" target="_blank">WRI India</a>, where I am closely engaged with urban local bodies (ULB) in framing and implementing sectoral air pollution strategies to curb air pollution inside the metropolitan area.
