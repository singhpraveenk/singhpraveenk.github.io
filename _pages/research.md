<p style="text-align: justify;">The Central Himalaya pose a significant gap in terms of black carbon monitoring. During 2015–2018, eight black carbon (BC) monitoring stations were established in Nepal and Bhutan to fill this significant data gap. Complex topography, varied emission sources, and atmospheric transport pathways significantly impacted the BC concentrations across these stations, with annual mean concentrations varying from 36 ng m−3 to 45,737 ng m−3. Higher annual mean concentrations (5609 ± 4515 ng m−3) were recorded at low-altitude sites than in other locations, with seasonal concentrations highest in the winter (7316 ± 2541 ng m−3). In contrast, the annual mean concentrations were lowest at high-altitude sites (376 ± 448 ng m−3); the BC concentrations at these sites peaked during the pre-monsoon season (930 ± 685 ng m−3). Potential source contributions to the total observed BC were analyzed using the absorption angstrom exponent (AAE). AAE analysis showed the dominance of biomass-burning sources (>50 %), except in Kathmandu.
