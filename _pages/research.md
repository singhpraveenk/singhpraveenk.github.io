<p style="text-align: justify;">The Central Himalaya pose a significant gap in terms of black carbon monitoring. During 2015–2018, eight black carbon (BC) monitoring stations were established in Nepal and Bhutan to fill this significant data gap. Complex topography, varied emission sources, and atmospheric transport pathways significantly impacted the BC concentrations across these stations, with annual mean concentrations varying from 36 ng m−3 to 45,737 ng m−3.</p>
