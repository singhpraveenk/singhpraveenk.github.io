<b>Black carbon aerosol in the Central Himalaya</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Central Himalaya pose a significant gap in terms of black carbon monitoring. During 2015–2018, eight black carbon (BC) monitoring stations were established in Nepal and Bhutan to fill this significant data gap. Complex topography, varied emission sources, and atmospheric transport pathways significantly impacted the BC concentrations across these stations, with annual mean concentrations varying from 36 ng m<sup>−3</sup> to 45,737 ng m<sup>−3</sup>. Higher annual mean concentrations (5609 ± 4515 ng m<sup>−3</sup>) were recorded at low-altitude sites than in other locations, with seasonal concentrations highest in the winter (7316 ± 2541 ng m<sup>−3</sup>). In contrast, the annual mean concentrations were lowest at high-altitude sites (376 ± 448 ng m<sup>−3</sup>); the BC concentrations at these sites peaked during the pre-monsoon season (930 ± 685 ng m<sup>−3</sup>). Potential source contributions to the total observed BC were analyzed using the absorption angstrom exponent (AAE). AAE analysis showed the dominance of biomass-burning sources (>50 %), except in Kathmandu.</p>

<b>The assessment of black carbon over the Hindu Kush Himalayan region</b>

<img src="/images/Assessment_Black_Carbon_HKH.jpg" alt="Assessment Balck carbon over HKH region" width="600" height="300" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">By combining our data with previously published literature, we put our measurements in perspective by presenting a comprehensive assessment of BC concentrations and their variability over the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. Persistent seasonal meteorology significantly influenced the high, mid, and low altitude BC levels in all three geographic areas. However, the mid-altitude stations were substantially affected by valley dynamics and urbanization. The low-altitude stations experienced high BC concentrations during the winter and post-monsoon seasons. Concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) and frequency analyses revealed the dominance of long-range transported pollution during winter over HKH, from west to east. South Asian sources remained significant during the monsoon season. During pre- and post-monsoon, the local, regional, and long-distance pollution varied depending on the location of the receptor site.</p>
