<p style="text-align: justify;">The Central Himalaya poses a significant gap in terms of black carbon monitoring. During 2015–2018, eight black carbon (BC) monitoring stations were established in Nepal and Bhutan to fill this significant data gap. Complex topography, varied emission sources, and atmospheric transport pathways significantly impacted the BC concentrations across these stations, with annual mean concentrations varying from 36 ng m<sup>−3</sup> to 45,737 ng m<sup>−3</sup>. Higher annual mean concentrations (5609 ± 4515 ng m<sup>−3</sup>) were recorded at low-altitude sites than in other locations, with seasonal concentrations highest in the winter (7316 ± 2541 ng m<sup>−3</sup>). In contrast, the annual mean concentrations were lowest at high-altitude sites (376 ± 448 ng m<sup>−3</sup>); the BC concentrations at these sites peaked during the pre-monsoon season (930 ± 685 ng m<sup>−3</sup>). Potential source contributions to the total observed BC were analyzed using the absorption angstrom exponent (AAE). AAE analysis showed the dominance of biomass-burning sources (>50 %), except in Kathmandu.</p>

<b>The assessment of black carbon over the Hindu Kush Himalayan region</b>

<img src="/images/Assessment_Black_Carbon_HKH.jpg" alt="Assessment Balck carbon over HKH region" width="600" height="300" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">By combining our data with previously published literature, we put our measurements in perspective by presenting a comprehensive assessment of BC concentrations and their variability over the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. Persistent seasonal meteorology significantly influenced the high, mid, and low altitude BC levels in all three geographic areas. However, the mid-altitude stations were substantially affected by valley dynamics and urbanization. The low-altitude stations experienced high BC concentrations during the winter and post-monsoon seasons. Concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) and frequency analyses revealed the dominance of long-range transported pollution during winter over HKH, from west to east. South Asian sources remained significant during the monsoon season. During pre- and post-monsoon, the local, regional, and long-distance pollution varied depending on the location of the receptor site.</p>

<b>Aerosol composition, transport, and radiative impact derived from ground-based and satellite remote sensing</b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The individual contributions of light-absorbing aerosols, i.e., BC, OC, and dust, to the aerosol absorption were quantified over the Central Himalaya, a poorly studied and sensitive region, ranging from low to high altitude, using the in-situ observations. The seasonal mean SSA, AAOD, and AOD values were found in the range of 0.76 ± 0.017 to 0.99 ± 0.005, 0.001 ± 0.0004 to 0.067 ± 0.034, and 0.083 ± 0.003 to 0.751 ± 0.328 at all sites. Several stations showed lower SSA values during the pre-monsoon, inferring the dominance of the light-absorbing aerosols originating from natural and anthropogenic sources. We utilized external and internal mixing approaches to estimate aerosol component fractions. The results from the external mixing approach showed the presence of >50 % of BC and < 10 % of the dust in most of the high and mid-altitude sites. However, the presence of dust was greater at the low-altitude sites. Nevertheless, the presence of dust was estimated in almost all the sites, considering the internal mixing case. The results from both approaches agreed well with the CALIPSO aerosol subtype. Though a few discrepancies were found, the MG approximation occasionally overestimated the dust fraction. The aerosol radiative forcing at the surface and in the atmosphere showed an increasing trend toward the lower altitude, except for a few anomalies at Kathmandu and Lumbini. The vertical aerosol extinction profiles were also analyzed, and vertical heating rates were calculated, which revealed a significant loading of aerosols above the 3 km altitude and a substantial presence of carbonaceous aerosols and heating over the 5 km altitude, crucial for the survival of glaciers. The study will improve the regional representation of aerosol compositions in climate simulations, the quantification of impact on the glaciers, and aerosol-induced changes in the hydrological cycle in the region.</p>
